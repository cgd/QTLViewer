# QTL Viewer

### Standard version:

### Kinect version:

**Installation**  
Requires simple-openni wrapper for Processing. See <http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/wiki/Installation>.  

**Setup**

Stand about 10 feet from the Kinect sensor. On the right side of the screen there is a camera display; make sure that your limbs are visible. To calibrate, hold both hands at head level with shoulders and elbows making right angles.  

**Interaction**

* Use your right hand to control the cursor (it's a red circle). The cursor becomes more sensitive to movement as your hand gets further from your body. If your hand drops below the threshold of sensitivity, it will become translucent.
  * To select an item, keep your hand in the same position for two seconds. A blue circle will begin to wrap around the circle, activating after a full revolution. Activation will fail if the cursor is moved. After activation, the cursor will have to be moved again to allow another action.
